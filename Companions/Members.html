        <p>Kodlak Whitemane is the Harbinger of the Companions in Whiterun. He has commanded the Companions for twenty
            years, balancing his tactical skill, ferocity in combat, and commanding presence. As Harbinger, he is the
            one that helps channel the Companions' skills in a way that can benefit Skyrim's people, rather than leaving
            them to brawl and drink all day long. His wisdom is respected throughout the nine holds, as well.</p><br>
